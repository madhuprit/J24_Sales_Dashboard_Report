# J24_Sales_Dashboard_Report
I’m thrilled to share my Sales Dashboard Report, a project focused on dissecting sales performance across different markets and timeframes.

Starting with raw data, I used Power Query to clean and transform the inputs, setting the stage for robust analysis. I then built an interactive interface featuring bar, pie, and line charts to visualize the "where" and "how" of revenue generation.

To make the dashboard truly useful for decision-making, I added drill-down capabilities allowing users to filter by specific sales reps or categories, alongside clear KPIs for instant health checks on the business. This experience has been invaluable for sharpening my data modeling and DAX abilities while teaching me how to design dashboards that are as intuitive as they are informative.Sales
